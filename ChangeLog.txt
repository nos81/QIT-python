Changelog for Quantum Information Toolkit (Python version)

+ added
- removed
* changed
b bugfix


0.9.10      2011-06-26 (first public beta)
              * based on the MATLAB QIT version 0.9.9, with several bugfixes.
              + Sphinx documentation.

0.9.11      2012-08-22
              * Bump dependencies: matplotlib 1.0.1+, NumPy 1.5.1+, SciPy 0.9.0+.
                This fixes several problems with 3D plotting.
                Sparse matrix handling is improved.
              + setup.py, proper distutils packaging.
              b 3D subplots fixed.

0.9.12      2012-08-31
              * Initialization message removed.
              * Better documentation, docstring backslash problems fixed.
              * Preparing for Python 3 conversion: added the absolute_import and
                unicode_literals __future__ features. Now we use every non-redundant
                __future__ feature available in Python 2.6.
              * examples.bb84() now also prints the interesting stuff.
              * examples.quantum_channels and examples.nmr_sequences use GridSpec to define the subplots.
              * utils.majorize() now uses tolerances.
              * Entire seq module revamped.
              * Renamed some functions in the plot module by removing the redundant plot_ prefix.
              * plot.bloch_sphere no longer accepts a state as input.
              + Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm example.
              + lmap.norm()
              + lmap.trace()
              + utils.rand_pu(), this is how utils.rand_positive() now gets its partition of unity.
              + utils.rand_SL()
              + invariant.LU()
              + plot.state_trajectory(), plot.correlation_simplex_2q()
              b setup.py fixed.
              b eig/eigh, eigvals/eigvalsh in state.propagate() and elsewhere.
                Now we get orthonormal eigenvectors with degenerate eigenvalues as well.
              b utils.expv() no longer crashes with a cryptic error message when
                given np.matrix instances as input, now raising an exception instead.
