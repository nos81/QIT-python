b bugfix


0.9.10      2011-06-26 (first public beta)
              * based on the MATLAB QIT version 0.9.9, with several bugfixes.
              + Sphinx documentation.

0.9.11      2012-08-22
              * Bump dependencies: matplotlib 1.0.1+, NumPy 1.5.1+, SciPy 0.9.0+.
                This fixes several problems with 3D plotting.
                Sparse matrix handling is improved.
              + setup.py, proper distutils packaging.
              b 3D subplots fixed.

0.9.12      in progress
              + Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm example.
              + lmap.trace()
              + invariant.LU()
	      * Initialization message removed.
              * Better documentation, docstring backslash problems fixed.
              * examples.bb84() now also prints the interesting stuff.
              * Preparing for Python 3 conversion: added the absolute_import and
                unicode_literals __future__ features. Now we use every non-redundant
                __future__ feature available in Python 2.6.
              b setup.py fixed.
              b eig/eigh, eigvals/eigvalsh in state.propagate() and elsewhere.
                Now we get orthonormal eigenvectors with degenerate eigenvalues as well.
